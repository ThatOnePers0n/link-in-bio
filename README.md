# Link In Bio
### This is a simple link in bio template that can be freely modified with credit.

This is a modified version made with Eleventy. This link tree is the same as seen (here)[https://minodabproductions.dev/links]. To set this up, create a new project with node.js, and add Eleventy as a package. Modify the HTML and CSS to change the profile picture, and backgrounds, and change the file at /data/links.json to change the button links and names that the page shows. Run npx eleventy --serve afterwards to compile the output html and css files. These will output in the _site directory. These are what you would upload/share.

Credit to the Eleventy-ification to MinoDab492... I don't know why I did this, but I made it, and now you guys get to use it too.
